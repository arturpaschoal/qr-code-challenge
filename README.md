### Overview

I thought that the project was challenging for me cause I'm a begginer, but I think I did well, used some basic things that I learned and I'm happy with how it worked out. Please judge my solution and feel free to hint me up, I will gladly receive messages of support and help from you!

### What I learned

I learned how to size a box and how to center things well. The way I used to do went bad and did not look well when I used the mobile simulator, the website kept looking bugged, but I researched and fixed it!!

The other things I did was using basic knowledge that I got from the Web development course that I'm doing!!

### Continued development

I would like to keep developing my div, sizing and positioning knowledge, and a lot of other stuff that I need to learn for making better websites cause obviously it's never too much to learn!


### Useful resources

I researched a lot of the position tips and tricks in W3Schools and used a lot of DevDocs.io
